## Module 4

Next week there will be no class at all, as it the "education week". With this education week and the other holidays this period, we're required to merge some of the modules to leave enough room in the schedule of the courses. For this year, that means we won't be able to cover decision trees topic and a part of webscraping. We'll instead publish the content here as optional modules, which is not part of the exam material, and so does *not* need to be submitted at all. Feel free to try these optional module whenever you're interested in learning more about these topics.

We'll publish module 5 after the education week, so on Monday the 6th of May. Enjoy your holiday!



#### Office hours

The office hours will be held in room **L0.10 at 10:00** on the scheduled day. During office hours you can use the question queue to ask the staff any further explanations on the theory of that module, or discuss any personal matters.

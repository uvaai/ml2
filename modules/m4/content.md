## Module 4

Next week there will be no class at all, as it the "education week". With this education week and the other holidays this period, we're required to merge some of the modules to leave enough room in the schedule of the courses. For this year, that means we won't be able to cover the decision trees topic as part of the course. We'll instead publish the content here as an optional module, which is not part of the exam material, and so does not need to be submitted on Friday April 26th at all. Feel free to try this optional module whenever you're interested in learning about another type of ML algorithm.

#### Office hours

The office hours will be held in room **L0.10 at 10:00** on the scheduled day. During office hours you can use the question queue to ask the staff any further explanations on the theory of that module, or discuss any personal matters.

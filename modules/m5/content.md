### Guest lecture

There will be a guest lecture *Wednesday December 6th at 15:00 in room F2.04*. This lecture will not be part of the exam material, but will cover one of the latest revolutions in AI, namely diffusion models.

Machine learning algorithms like Dall-e2, MidJourney and StableDIffusion have shaken the creative world to its core, and opened up a disruptive new way for people to express their artistic ideas:
Using only words, anyone can now translate their vision into stunning imagery. In this lecture we'll shed light on the disruptive technology that has made this revolution possible: Diffusion models.
Starting from a two-pixel universe all the way up to astronomically large datasets, we'll build up an intuition for the mathematical clockwork that makes diffusion models tick,
we'll develop practical insights into using these models in your own code, and finally, we'll learn why "trending on artstation" is actually a synonym for "beautiful".

#### Quiz/lecture

The quiz/lecture will be held in room **L0.11 at 14:00** on the scheduled day.

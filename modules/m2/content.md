### Lectures

There are two scheduled lectures for this module:

* **Neural Networks: Theory + Representation** on *Tuesday November 9th at 13:00* in room A1.16A

* **Neural Networks: Additional Q&A** on *Thursday November 11th at 11:00* in room G3.02

### Online morning meetings

For the students working from home, there will be a morning meeting organised
every day at **09:00** where you can start your day together. You can join the
meeting at
[Wonder.me](https://www.wonder.me/r?id=c6cdcb4d-7901-44dc-9b9f-fe90898c22a5).

There you can discuss planning for the day and potenially find other students
that be starting the same part of an assignment as you, so you can
then decide to take a look at your approach for a problem together.

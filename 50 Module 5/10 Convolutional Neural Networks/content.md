# Convolutional Neural Networks

This week, we'll take a look at a video from the MIT course "Introduction to Deep Learning". The video you will be watching is on Convolutional Neural Networks and discusses what computers see, how you would go about extracting features from images, and explains why Convolutional Neural Networks are required when using large images.

# Convolutional Neural Networks

This week, we'll start with a video from the MIT course "Introduction to Deep
Learning". The video you will be watching is on Convolutional Neural Networks
and discusses what computers see, how you would go about extracting features
from images, and explains why Convolutional Neural Networks are required when
using large images.

## Convolutional Filters

Next up, we'll take a look at some videos from Mike Pound from the
Computerphile channel, which go into a little more detail on how convolutions
are used in image processing, what the common types of filters are and how
these filters are used to build a CNN.

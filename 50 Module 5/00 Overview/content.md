# Convolutional Neural Networks

This week, we will start with an introduction to the terminology used in
computer vision. We will discuss and implement the different concepts that
underlie the current state of the art methods of analyzing visual imagery, and
eventually work up to a model that can classify different pictures of clothing.

Near the end of this week's notebook we will start using TensorFlow in
combination with Keras. TensorFlow is very similar to PyTorch in that it offers
you methods that can help you to easily implement all kinds of variants of
Machine Learning. PyTorch offers great customisability and performance and
handles very similar to NumPy, while TensorFlow and Keras offer very high level
instructions and handles very similar to Scikit Learn. Ultimately, it does not
really matter which library you pick, which is why we chose to include
assignments with both libraries; to familiarize you with two of the libraries
that are used the most.

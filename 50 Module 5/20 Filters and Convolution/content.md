## Filters and Convolution

In this notebook we'll learn how to apply filters and convolution to images,
and how to use this to make a Convolutional Neural Network.

For this assignment you'll need a library that is not (yet) included in your
`progLab` Anaconda environment. To install it, execute the following commands:

    conda activate progLab
    conda install scikit-image

Type "y" to confirm and the missing packages will be installed.

To get started, download the zip with notebook and data [here](cnn.zip).

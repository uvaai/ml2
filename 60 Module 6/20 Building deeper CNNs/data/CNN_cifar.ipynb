    "\n",
    "The basic CNN model seems to clearly be overfitting, but before we address that, we'll start by normalizing the input. This is a first step that is important for many ML models, but specifically for deep neural networks, as ReLU activations are only actually non-linear around an input of 0 (where the input switches from 0 to a linear output). This means that, for the ReLU activations to really be effective, you would want the average combined inputs to end up around 0, which is why *mean centering the data* is so important.\n",
    "\n",
    "You could use something like `np.mean` to compute the average input in all the training images and then subtract that average from every input, but the easiest way is to use the data preprocessor [ImageDataGenerator](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/preprocessing/image/ImageDataGenerator). To use this together with the `train_and_evaluate()` function, you'll need to use the optional `preprocess` argument, which is a [keyword argument dictionary](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-argument).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each key in the *keyword argument dictionary* should be a string of the keyword you want to pass to the function and the value in the dictionary should be the corresponding parameter value you want to pass to the function. In order to mean center the data, we want to enable `featurewise_center`, so that would look like\n",

In addition, the training data should be normalized to have a standard deviation of 1, for which there is also a keyword argument.

    "\n",
    "Start by copying the model from the cell before and then modify the `train_and_evaluate()` call to apply the mean centering and standard deviation normalization preprocessing to your data. If done correctly, your validation accuracy should increase to about *71%*.\n"

An important thing to note about the training cost here is that it may again become higher than the validation cost. During training, dropout is active and some of the inputs get dropped, but when evaluating the validation data, all inputs are used, probably resulting in better prediction and thus a lower cost. To get a better estimate of the true training cost, we would need to add a full evaluation of the training data at each epoch too, but then we'd effectively double the computation for training data at each epoch, making the algorithm much slower.

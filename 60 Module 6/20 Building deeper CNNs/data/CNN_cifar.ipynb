For this module we'll look at a few more interesting additions you can make to a neural network and practice using *Tensorflow* to build the network.\n",

    "Looking at the learning curves, the network also doesn't seem to be overfitting any more! An important thing to note about the training cost here is that it may again become higher than the validation cost. During training, dropout is active and some of the inputs get dropped, but when evaluating the validation data, all inputs are used, probably resulting in better prediction and thus a lower cost. To get a better estimate of the true training cost, we would need to add a full evaluation of the training data at each epoch too, but then we'd effectively double the computation for training data at each epoch, making the algorithm much slower. The training cost's current curve still has a useful shape for analysis, but the true training cost would be lower at every epoch.\n",

## Building deeper CNN's

The last programming assignment of this course will be split into two parts:

For the first part you'll work through a step by step example for building a
deeper CNN using the CIFAR-10 data set. The notebook for this can be downloaded
[here](data/CNN_cifar.ipynb).

For the second part you'll build a deep CNN yourself using the GTSRB data set.
The notebook for this can be downloaded [here](data/CNN_gtsrb.ipynb).

It is recommended that you run both these notebooks as [Google
Colab's](https://colab.research.google.com). Instructions for this can be found
in the CIFAR-10 notebook.

# Deep Learning

The [theory videos](/module-6/deep-learning) this week will
introduce some more from deep learning and some of the useful tools and tricks
to get these deeper networks to still learn useful representations. The 
[programming notebook](/module-6/building-deeper-cnns) will consist of two
parts where you're practice applying these tools to two different data sets.

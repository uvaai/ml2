# Introduction to Machine Learning 2

University of Amsterdam / Programming Lab / 50822ITM6Y

## Syllabus<br><small>Spring 2025</small>

This course is the continuation of Introduction to Machine Learning 1. In ML1
you've learned about some of the basic algorithms in machine learning and to
what types of problems they can be applied. For ML2 we'll be focussing more on
combining smaller models as components into bigger and more complex models, most
notably neural networks.

## Staff

Tim Doolan (coordinator)

Wouter Vrielink (teacher)

You can reach us at <ai@proglab.nl> for any practical matters or other
questions.

## Schedule

The core schedule for this course, combined with Python for Data Processing, is
built around working with the material each weekday from 9 to 5. For this we
have one room on the Science Park campus permanently reserved for minor AI
students, namely **L0.10**, which provides enough space for all of you to work
on campus full-time.

Most on-campus activities, including practical assistance, will generally be
held in this room. There are some exceptions with activities that do not fit
in the room, like the group seminars and the exam. The schedule for these
group seminars can be found on Datanose [here](https://datanose.nl/#course[119468])

The schedule for the practical assistance hours that will be held in L0.10 can
be found in the "Asking Questions" section below.

### Deadlines and daily schedules

The deadlines for each module can be found on the module schedule pages
(the first item in the sidebar for each module).

We've found that it can be difficult for students to plan when to work on what
part of the material, especially with two completely new courses, that together
require a full-time time investment. Being unfamiliar with a subject makes it a
lot harder to estimate how long something might take, and structuring your work
can be more difficult. To help with all of this, we've made a day-to-day schedule
for each module, which indicates what elements should be completed each day.

If you're finding it hard to keep on track with the daily schedule, you can
contact the staff at <ai@proglab.nl>. We can discuss possible approaches or
even offer extra help or resources, if needed. In general, it is a good idea to
already contact us if are more than 1 day behind on the schedule, so we can
look at possible solutions early.

#### Part-time students

If you are a part-time student, you can just follow the part of the daily
schedule intended for your half of the program. You should still attend the
group seminars with the other students, but can otherwise choose which days
you are present and which days of practical assistance combine best
with your own schedule.

### Absences and calling in sick

If you are sick or are otherwise unable to come to campus, you should inform
your group TA you will be absent by sending them a message on Slack. When you
are feeling better, inform your TA again, so your period of absence can be
registered.

Depending on how long you were sick, and if you are behind with the module, you
can then also contact the course staff to discuss an alternate planning for the
module. Note that this option requires you to have also already messaged your
TA at the start of your absense. Any exceptions or extensions required for this
will need to be discussed with course staff (so not your TA). See the extension
policy below for more details.

### Extension policy and late days

There are two types of extension; staff extensions and late days.

Staff extensions usually require meeting with staff and will generally also
include making an alternative planning for the module. If any circumstances
arise that would make it hard for you to make the deadline, send us an
email at <ai@proglab.nl> so we can discuss your situation. Please do this as
soon as the problem arises, rather than on the day of deadline, so we can
schedule a meeting and still have room in the module for an alternative planning.
Note that a meeting does not always guarantee an extension, as this might still
depend on the details of your circumstances.

In addition, for this course and Python for Data Processing, you have a
combined total of 2 late days, each of which you can use to get a single 24
hour extension for the module deadline. You can request a late day using the
submit forms linked in the sidebar of the main
[minor AI website](https://minai.proglab.nl/). You must always submit your
request *before* the deadline expires. Any submissions received after the
deadline without a requested late day will not be graded, meaning your grade
will default to a 1.

You can use only 1 late day per module to get a 24 hour extension on the deadline.
This extension is for the whole module, so applies to both courses. If the deadline
is on a Friday, using  a single late day will instead grant a 48 hour extension
over the weekend, meaning your deadline will move to Sunday. If you have used both
late days, or require more than 24 hours of extension, you may still try and
request a staff extension.

Any staff extension request needs to be agreed upon before the deadline expires,
which means your request must be sent at least 2 hours before the actual deadline.
If you do not receive a reply in time, you should *always* still submit your
current version of the assignment before the deadline, so this part can still be
graded. Staff extension requests should be emailed to <ai@proglab.nl>

## Asking questions

If you have any questions about the material, there are several ways to ask them
and get assistance.

### Practical assistance

There are 2.5 hours scheduled every day where you can ask practical questions
to the TA's of the minor. During these hours you can use the "Assistance"
feature on the main [minor AI website](https://minai.proglab.nl/), using the
question mark symbol in the top right corner of that page. Please use this
feature instead of raising your hand in class, as it ensures that all questions
get handled in the order that they are asked.  Questions can of be about either
the DPR or ML2 courses, just make sure to mention what assignment you're
working on. For your location, please list the table you are working at, so the
TA handling your question knows where to find you when it is your turn.

The assistance hours are scheduled each day from 10:00 to 12:30.

### Office hours

Students in the minor AI, as with any minor, tend to come from very diverse
backgrounds, which makes a traditional centralized lecture aimed at all
students difficult. So, instead the course content is mainly presented using
theory videos and reading material, while the staff is also frequently
available for questions.

Every module there will be at least one planned set of office hours, where you
can ask the staff any questions you might have about theoretical parts of the
course. The schedule for these office hours can be found as part of the daily
schedule for the module. The office hours will always be together with the
practical assistance hours in the main room L0.10.

During the office hours, you can use the same "Assistance" feature to ask any
further explanations on the theory of that module. Simply start your question
description with "[00]" to indicate it is for staff. If these explanations are
relevant relevant for a larger number of students, they might be covered on the
board, but in general, questions will be answered individually or in smaller
groups. The office hours can also be used for any other matters you might want
to discuss with staff, such as personal matters or an alternate planning.

### Seminars

Once a week on there are separate group seminars with your own TA. The
topics covered in these seminars will depend on the material of that week: how
to improve the style and design of your code, discussing the some of the
written assignment topics, or some small programming exercises to practice
with the group. In addition, you can always use these seminars to ask you TA any
questions you might have about the feedback they gave you as part of the grading for
the previous module. The schedule for the group seminars can be found on Datanose
[here](https://datanose.nl/#course[119468])

### Email the staff

If you have personal matters to discuss or other questions that do not fit any
of the formats above, you can email the course staff at <ai@proglab.nl>

## Passing the course

Passing the attendace requirement each week is required to pass the course.
The programming and writing assignment will both be graded on a 1 to 10 scale.
and at the end of the course an average for both these elements will be
computed. The minimum satisfactory average grade from the assignments is a
4.5 and the minimum grade for the exam is also a 4.5.

If all elements are completed satisfactorily, your final grade for the course is computed as:

    40% programming average + 20% written average + 40% exam grade

### Attendance

As a full-time student, we expect you to be present and working on campus every
weekday from 9 to 5. The material of these course covers a lot of practical
skills, which cannot just be learned from reading a book or watching a video.
This means we expect you'll need to ask plenty questions while working on
assignments, as you try and master these different skills. This is also why we
offer practical assistance every day of the week.

As asking questions is such a fundamental part of the way we expect you to
learn, attendance for some of the practical assistance is mandatory. This is
not required for every single practical session, but you should attend the
majority of the practicals offered. Each week there are 6 lessons you can
attend: practical assistance every day of the week, and a seminar with your own
TA once per week. Of these you should attend at minimum 4 per week to receive a
pass for the attendance that week. Note that for parttime students the
requirement is only to attend 2 lessons each week.

#### Rules regarding attendance

* You need to attend 4 out of 6 lessons each week as a fulltime student, or 2 out of 6 as a parttime student
* Attendance will be taken during the practical assistance each day at 10:15 and students entering after 10:30 will not be registered present
* If you are registered sick (see the section *Absenses* above), you are also exempted from attendance on those days
* If you need an exception for the attendance of a week for whatever reason, this should be arranged *before* the start of that week with course staff (this is a type of staff exception, as described above)
* If you are done with all the material for the module before the day of the deadline, you can show your assignments to a TA *during practical assistance*. The TA will check if they agree every element has been properly completed, and if so you'll be granted exemption from the attendance checks for the rest of the module.
* If you receive a fail for the attendance of one week, you should make arrangements with the staff to compensate this *the following week*. If an attendance fail is not corrected the week after, it is no longer possible to pass the course.

### Programming Grades

All programming notebooks should run from top to bottom without errors, using
`Cell > Run All`. Your grade for the programming notebooks depends on 3
factors: Correctness of the produced output, answers to the open questions, and
the style and design of the code.

If all coding cells are completed, all open questions are answered and your
notebook runs top to bottom without errors, your grade starts at a 6. The
remainder of your grade is then determined as follows:

* 0 - Some code cells produce incorrect or incomplete results. Answers to some open questions are incorrect or lack motivations.

* 1 - All code cells produce mostly correct results, but may still contain small mistakes. Same goes for the answers to open questions. Style and design have had some attention, but can be improved.

* 2 - All code cells produce correct results. Answers to all open questions are correct and are motivated. Style and design are good.

* 3 - All code cells produce correct and nicely formatted results. Answers to all open questions are correct and consistently well motivated based on the theory of the algorithm. Style and design are very good.

* 4 - Above, and in addition: Output, answers and code cells are beyond what is expected for the course.

### Writing Grades

The writing assignments for this course might be different from writing
assignments you've done in your own studies. We'll start by outlining the
basic concept, in order to avoid confusion of what you are exactly graded on.

The most important aspect of your writing assignments is to show you've read
the week's material and have thought carefully about the accompanying
questions. Some questions might even just ask your opinion, which means all
that is required is that you've thought about the topic enough to clearly argue
*why* you think it is one way or the other. Specifically, this also means that
not every statement you make necessarily requires a reference or citation.
However, if you do look up other sources as part of formulating your answers,
you can of course use and cite them.

Your grade for each writing assignment is determined as the sum of your points for each of the three aspects listed in the rubric below.

|                   | *Unsatisfactory*               | *Satisfactory*                  | *Good*                          | *Exceptional*                      |
|-------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Instructions**  | **1:** Significant parts of the assignment are missing and/or the writing contains too few words. | **3:** The student has almost completed the assignment, but minor aspects of the assignment are missing, like incomplete answers, or a missing question. | **5:** The writing contains a sufficient number of words, refers back to the concepts covered the reading material, and contains answers to all of the questions from the assignment. | - |
|-------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Structure<br>& style** | **0:** The writing contains (almost) no structure, and/or the style is (at some points) unclear, thereby making the answers more difficult to understand. | **1:** Overall the answers are well structured and the style is clear, making the answers in general easy to understand. | - | **2:** The answers are very well structured and the style is very clear and accessible, beyond what is expected for the course. |
|-------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Argumentation** | **0:** A concept from the reading material is misrepresented and/or some motivations are missing. | **1:** The writing shows a general understanding of the reading material and the corresponding concepts. All answers are motivated, but one or two motivations might be incomplete or inconsistent. | **2:** The writing shows clear understanding of the reading material and the corresponding concepts. All answers are well motivated using these concepts. | **3:** In addition to showing a clear understanding and well-motivated answers, the writing contains other sources or examples from the author’s field of study, thereby providing relevant novel perspectives. |
|-------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------|

### Exam

The exam at the end of the course will consist mainly of open questions on the
theory and algorithms covered. More details on the exam will follow later.


## Academic honesty

This course's philosophy on academic honesty is best stated as "be reasonable".
The course recognizes that interactions with classmates and others can
facilitate mastery of the course's material. However, there remains a line
between enlisting the help of another and submitting the work of another. This
policy characterizes both sides of that line.

### Collaboration

The essence of all work that you submit in this course must be your own.
This means that for collaboration with other students you can discuss
the material and consider possible approaches together, but you should then
always still each write your own code. So, conferring together using language
and whiteboards is permitted and even encouraged, but sharing lines of code is
not.

Note that looking at another students screen or solution file at this stage
will usually result in that option becoming *the* solution to the problem, and
so instead of learning and considering all the possibilities, you just end up
trying to recreate the solution you already saw. As there usually quite a few
different ways to solve programming problems, this can even end up with code
that is similar enough in structure that it is caught by our automated
plagiarism detector.

### Helping other students

Once you've completed a part of an assignment, viewing another student's solution
is fine and can even be very helpful. At this point you can help other students
to find bugs in their code, or even do a code review together when you're both
done. Helping other students to find bugs in their code is something that is
also definitely encouraged, but this should always be limited to suggestions on
what to try next, not fixing the code for them. If you are trying to suggest a
fix, but cannot do so without sharing your own code (which is common enough
when you are still learning!), then you should refer the problem to a TA or
teacher instead.

The general principle here is that you can look at another's code to help fix a
bug, but they cannot look at your code for ideas on how to solve it. Note that
sharing a solution with someone who has not yet completed that part of the
assignment is considered plagiarism just as much as handing in another students
solution. Doing this deprives the other student from learning what they need
to learn in that assignment, which will only make it more difficult for them to
solve subsequent assignments on their own.

### Using online tools

Searching for solutions to (parts of) the assignments online is obviously not
permitted. This explicitly also includes asking ChatGPT or other large language
models to write the code for you, which is considered plagiarism just as much as
copying a solution written by another human.

What is permitted though, is searching for explanations on how to use certain
functions or perform specific operations in Python. So, searching for *"how do
I add an element to a list in Python"* would be perfectly fine, while searching
for *"how do I print a Mario pyramid in Python"* would not. If your search
leads to a Stack Overflow page or similar resource, which gives an example of
how to perform an operation, you should always cite the source as a comment
in your own code. This citation comment should contain the original link and
clearly indicate which parts you did not write yourself, but came from the
online example.

As a student it can sometimes be hard to estimate what is and isn't ok to
search for online, which is logical while you are still learning. We strongly
recommend that you err on the side of caution with this, and ask staff
permission beforehand for a specific search when in doubt. As this is an
introductory course, you should actually be able to find all the relevant
Python instructions on the pages of this course without needing to search
online at all.

### Rules and guidelines

Below are rules of thumb that (inexhaustively) characterize acts that the
course considers reasonable and not reasonable. If in doubt as to whether some
act is reasonable, do not commit it until you solicit and receive approval in
writing from the course's staff. Acts considered not reasonable by the course
are handled harshly.

In all cases we follow the directives regarding fraud and plagiarism of the
University of Amsterdam and of the Kunstmatige Intelligentie BSc programme.

#### Reasonable

- Communicating with classmates about assignments in English, Dutch, or some other spoken language.

- Discussing the course's material with others in order to understand it better.

- Helping a classmate identify a bug in his or her code, elsewhere, or even online, as by viewing, or running his or her code, even on your own computer.

- Incorporating a few lines of code that you find online or elsewhere into your own code, provided that those lines are not themselves solutions to assigned problems and that you cite the lines' origins.

- Sending or showing code that you've written to someone, possibly a classmate, so that he or she might help you identify and fix a bug.

- Sharing a few lines of your own code online so that others might help you identify and fix a bug.

- Turning to the web or elsewhere for instruction beyond the course's own, for references, and for solutions to technical difficulties, but not for outright solutions to assignment problems.

- Whiteboarding solutions to problem sets with others using diagrams or pseudocode but not actual code.

- Working with (and even paying) a tutor to help you with the course, provided the tutor does not do your work for you.

#### Not Reasonable

- Searching for or soliciting outright solutions to assignments online or elsewhere.

- Asking a classmate to see his or her solution to a problem set's problem before (re-)submitting your own.

- Asking ChatGPT or other large language models to write the code for (part of) an assignment for you.

- Failing to cite (as with comments) the origins of code or techniques that you discover outside of the course's own lessons and integrate into your own work, even while respecting this policy's other constraints.

- Giving or showing to a classmate a solution to part of an assignment when it is he or she, and not you, who is struggling to solve it.

- Paying or offering to pay an individual for work that you may submit as (part of) your own.

- Providing or making available solutions to assignments to individuals who might take this course in the future.

- Splitting an assignment's workload with another individual and combining your work.

- Submitting (after possibly modifying) the work of another individual.

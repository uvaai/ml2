## Applying Neural Networks to the CIFAR10 data set

For this last assignment we'll use Pytorch and a Google Colab notebook to apply
neural networks to a larger data set, CIFAR10. Google Colab offers a free GPU
computing platform and using Pytorch we can take advantage of the massive
speed-up that these GPU's offer. This make it feasible to learn larger problems
in a reasonable amount of time and thus should allow you to try out several
different versions of neural networks on the CIFAR10 data set.

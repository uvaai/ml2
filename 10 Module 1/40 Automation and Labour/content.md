# Automation and Labour

This week we'll dive deeper into the claim that the rise of AI will lead to
massive unemployment of low-skilled labourers, who are easily replaced by
machines. Start by reading this introductory *Medium* article on the topic:

[A. Suri - Artificial Intelligence and the rise of economic inequality](https://towardsdatascience.com/artificial-intelligence-and-the-rise-of-economic-inequality-b9d81be58bec)

Suri gives a good overview of the arguments usually used to state the
rise of AI will indeed lead to massive unemployment, but only briefly
mentions replies from the other perspective. The two replies he does mention
are:

### 1. Universal Basic Income

The first and most common reply is that implementing a Universal Basic Income
would solve the problem of unemployement caused by the continued improvements
in automation. Suri counters this solution with quotes from Collins on "fiscal
crisis of the state" and this "making capitalism unsustainable". Neither of
these really cut to the core of the many underlying problems a UBI would
potentially solve, and also depends on the assumption that capitalism is the
only viable economic system.

However, countering these arguments would really just changes the subject to
the advantages and disadvantges of UBI. Implementing a UBI would just as a
direct effect eliminate this potential problem of unemployment due to
automation, but that is not the only reason to argue for a UBI. Considering
pro's and con's of a UBI is an interesting political en economic exercise, but
does not address whether or not an increase in unemployment due to automations
is actually likely.

### 2. Polanyi's Paradox

The other reply seems to be that it might be overstated that AI will cause mass
unemployment. It is supported with a single quote about AI and "the ability to
communicate with other people and explain its decision-making process", which
really tells us very little about why exactly that might be overstated.

So, next we'll read the article where this quote comes from, to better
understand the possibility that this threat might be overstated:

[D.H. Autor - Polanyiâ€™s Paradox and the Shape of Employment Growth](polanyis_paradox_2014.pdf)

It is an interesting article, but quite long and a little dense in places.
You should definitely read sections *III* and *VI*, and the *conclusion* of the
article. All other sections are optional, if you're interested.

## Suri's vs. Autor's perspective

For the writing assignment of this week, you should argue, based on these two
articles, whether or not you actually think it is likely that increases in AI
technology will indeed lead to mass unemployment. If you consulte other
sources before coming to your conclusion, you should cite these in your answer
too, but this is not required.

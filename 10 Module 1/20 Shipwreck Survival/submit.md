# Shipwreck Survival

For the programming notebook this week, we'll implement Logistic regression and
try to predict whether a person survived the sinking of the Titanic.

Download the Jupyter notebook on Logistic Regression [here](data/logistic_regression.ipynb). 
You will also need the dataset containing passenger data of the Titanic, which
you can download [here](data/titanic.csv).

We have also included a supplement that explains how to derive the gradient for
logistic regression, which you can download [here](data/logistic_derivative.pdf).

# Shipwreck Survival

For the programming notebook this week, we'll implement Logistic regression and try to predict whether a person survived the sinking of the Titanic.

Download the Jupyter notebook on Logistic Regression [here](Logistic_Regression.ipynb). You will also need the dataset containing passenger data of the Titanic, which you can download [here](titanic.csv). We have also included a supplement that explains how to derive the gradient for logistic regression, which you can download [here](logistic_derivative.pdf).

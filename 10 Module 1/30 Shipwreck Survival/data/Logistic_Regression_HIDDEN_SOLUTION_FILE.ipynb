    "# Logistic Regression - Predicting shipwreck survival\n",
    "\n",
    "In this week's assignment you will implement a classification algorithm named Logistic Regression. This sounds very counter-intuitive, as regression is something entirely different than classification, but the Logistic Regression model is actually estimating the probability (which is a continuous value) that data can be assigned to a specific class out of a set of classes. We will focus on so-called binary classification problems, wherein there are two possible classes. Some of the examples of binary classification problems that Logistic Regression is able to solve are: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Email; spam or not spam \n",
    "- Online transactions; fraud or not fraud\n",
    "- Tumor; malignant or benign \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will be using the classic Titanic dataset. This data consists of demographic and traveling information for 891 of the Titanic's passengers, and the goal is to predict which of these passengers survived. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a summary of the data set's attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *PassengerId*: passenger ID assigned in this dataset\n",
    "- *Survived*: A Boolean indicating whether the passenger survived or not (0 = No; 1 = Yes); this is our target\n",
    "- *Pclass*: Passenger class (1 = 1st; 2 = 2nd; 3 = 3rd)\n",
    "- *Name*: field containing the name and title of the passenger\n",
    "- *Sex*: male/female\n",
    "- *Age*: age of the passenger in years\n",
    "- *SibSp*: number of siblings/spouses aboard\n",
    "- *Parch*: number of parents/children aboard\n",
    "- *Ticket*: ticket number\n",
    "- *Fare*: passenger fare in British Pounds\n",
    "- *Cabin*: location of the cabin, consisting of a letter indicating the deck, and a cabin number.\n",
    "- *Embarked*: port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can probably see, the dataset contains a mix of textual, continuous, categorical, and boolean variables. Before we can get into implementing and applying Logistic Regression, we will have to clean up the data. We will lead you through this process using functions a data-scientist might use, providing you with the tools that will help you prepare your own data in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code below, we have loaded the data and show its first few rows."

This variable has no descriptive value for the passenger, but it could still cause our machine learning model to find some correlations that are really just noise, so we should delete this whole column before using the data for training.\n",
    "- The mean of *Survived* indicates that out of the 891 people in our dataset, only ~38% of people survived. This can be deduced from the mean of the column, because the value 1 corresponds to survived and 0 corresponds to did not survive. As an example, when 90% of these values would be 1, we would end up with a mean of 0.9, as the other values are all zeros.\n",
    "- There are more people in *Passenger Class* 3 than in class 1 and 2 combined. This can be concluded from the fact that from the 50th percentile to the maximum value, every passenger is in third class.\n",
    "- There is at least one baby in our dataset, with an *Age* of 0.42, or 5 months. The oldest person is 80 years old. We can see this from the min and max values of the *Age* column.\n",
    "- There are 277 people of which we do not know the *Age*. We have 891 data entries, but the `count` for age is 714, so 891 - 714 = 277.\n",
    "- The majority of people has no *Siblings/Spouses* aboard. This can be concluded from the percentiles.\n",
    "- The majority of people has no *Parents/Children* aboard. This can be concluded from the percentiles.\n",
    "- There is a big difference in scale in data. Fare can be up to 512 pounds while the number of *Parents/Children* on board is only up to 6.  We can also see this in the standard deviations, where the difference is also very large. In his videos, Andrew Ng talks about feature scaling, which is something we should apply here.

Replacing the values randomly will probably create a lot of outliers and will probably result in our model not being able to learn what correlations there are within the data, so we will use a method that replaces missing values with values that are as generic as possible. The way to do this is to replace all missing values with a value that is inferred from the data that is available, where the easiest option is to just use the *mean* of all the non-missing values as the replacement value.\n",

    "Now that all data is numerical, we can continue to the next step. We have already observed that there is a big difference in scale in data. When using feature scaling you make sure that the different features in your dataset take on similar ranges of values. One of the ideas behind this is that after you apply feature scaling, gradient descent can converge more quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scipy's `stat` module has some interesting methods to do this, including the `zscore` method which you might recognise from the theory video:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\tilde{\\mathbf{x}}_j = \\frac{\\mathbf{x}_j - \\mu_j}{\\sigma_j} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $\\mathbf{x}_j$ is a vector of x-values for the $j^{th}$ column, $\\mu_j$, $\\sigma_j$ are the (scalar) mean and standard deviation for that same column and $\\tilde{\\mathbf{x}}_j$ is the scaled version of the feature vector. The basic principle here is that it transforms every value in the column $j$ to a value that indicates how many standard deviations the value originally was away from the mean of the data *in that column*. For example: a $Z$-score of $-2$ would indicate that the value was 2 standard deviations below the average, while a $Z$-score of $0$ would indicate that the value was actually equal to the mean of the column.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code below, we transform each of the non-categorical datacolumns using the `zscore` method, by applying it to each of the elements within. The function `zscore` conveniently takes care of computing all means and standard deviations for each column separately, and returns the scaled data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we do not want to apply this function to our categorical one-hot encoded data, as those are already in within a nice $[0,1]$ range and scaling these binary values by their mean and standard deviation wouldn't really make sense.\n"

    "### The Logistic function\n",
    "\n",
    "For Logistic Regression, we require a function that generates probabilities; a function that gives outputs between 0 and 1 for **all** inputs. There are many functions that meet this description, but the one that is used in logistic regression is the logistic function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ g(z) = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-z}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the function `logistic_func` that can either take a single value `z`, or an array of values `z`, and compute the *Logistic* function for each.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint:* Numpy built-in functions and basic arithmetic operations work on both Numpy arrays and single values. When the function detects that its input is a Numpy array, the operation it applies will be applied to each element in the array seperately, the result being a Numpy array of the same shape as the input. This is called *element-wise application*, and many mathematical operations have Numpy version that support element-wise application. Write your `logistic_func` in such a way that it can compute $g$ values for scalars or for entire vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, write some code that can plot the results for the logistic function between $-5$ and $5$. Use Numpy's [`np.linspace`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.linspace.html?highlight=linspace#numpy.linspace) to generate a range of $z$ values and use your `logistic_func` to calculate the corresponding $g$ values. Make sure the resulting plot looks correct, before moving on to the next step."

    "Next, we can start working on the hypothesis function, which will generate a hypothesis vector of class probabilities, given some matrix of inputs $X$ and a vector of weights $\\theta$. For logistic regression, we use the logistic function $g$ to transform the hypothesis we used in multivariate linear regression to a hypothesis function that only generates probabilities (i.e. results between 0 and 1):\n",

This will actually get somewhat easier when we write out the full vectorized version using the matrix $X$, as the rows and columns get their \"expected\" shape. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here the function $g$ is the Logistic function defined above. As you've just written `logistic_func` specifically to also work on vectors, if we construct a vector of $z$ values for the whole model at once, then we could also write the entire hypothesis function in vectorized form:\n",

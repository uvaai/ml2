# Week 7

This week we'll take a look at Logistic Regression. Logistic Regression is a
regression method used to model the probability of an input being
part of a certain class, so it is actually a classification technique.

This week's [SOWISO module](/week7/exponentials-and-logarithms) topics are
exponentials, logarithms, and differentiation, which are the required bits of
theory for Logistic Regression.

Then, we'll continue with [videos by Andrew Ng](/week7/logistic-regression)
videos on Logistic Regression, as well as a recap on feature scaling,
which is an essential part of this week's
[programming notebook](/week7/shipwreck-survival). In the notebook, you will
try to predict whether a person survived the Titanic shipwreck
using Logistic Regression.

Finally, this week's [written assignment](/week7/automation-and-labour) will
discuss the claim that the rise of AI technology is likely to cause massive
unemployment in the future.

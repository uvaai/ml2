# Decision Trees

This week we'll take a break from Neural Networks and cover a different class
of algorithms, namely Decision Trees. Decision Trees are a relatively simple
model (especially when compared to NN), that produce predictions and rules that
are much easier to interpret. However, an ensemble of Decision Trees, called a
Random Forest, can actually produce state of the art results on some tasks.

The theory videos introducing the algorithm can be found
[here](/module-4/decision-trees-random-forests) and the programming notebook to
apply this algorithm to heart disease prediction can be found
[here](/module-4/predicting-heart-disease).

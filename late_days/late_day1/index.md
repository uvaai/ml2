## Late day 1

Use this page to request a late day. For this course and Data Processing and Representations, you have a combined total of 2 late days, each of which you can use to get a single 24 hour extension for the module deadline.

You can use only 1 late day per module to get a 24 hour extension on the deadline. This extension is for the whole module, so applies to both courses. If the deadline is on a Friday, using a single late day will instead grant a 48 hour extension over the weekend, meaning your deadline will move to Sunday.

> Note that you must always submit your request before the deadline expires. Any submissions received after the deadline without a requested late day will not be graded, meaning your grade will default to a 1.

In the form below, enter _which_ module you would like an extension for. No additional information is required. If submitted before the deadline, your request will be approved automatically.

# Neural Networks

For the past weeks we've been studying the fundamentals of machine learning,
including the required mathematical tools, core theoretical concepts and the
details of specific algorithms. With all these fundamentals under our belt,
we've actually also developed the language required to discuss one of the
largest, most complex and most active area's in all of machine learning: Neural
networks.

This week we'll get our first introduction in Neural Networks, getting familiar
with what a neural network is exactly, and also why it is such a powerful
model. There are no new mathematical tools we'll need, so there won't be any SOWISO
modules. All of the relevant theorie will be covered in the
[videos](/module-2/neural-networks). For the programming this week we'll work
on a network that can do all of the required [forward
computation](/module-2/model-representation-forward-computation).

## Model Representation & Forward Computation

For the programming assignment this week we'll be implementing the model
representation and forward computation of a fully connected neural network with
Sigmoid activations. The model representation will be done using Object
Oriented programming and Sigmoid activations at each layer will consist of a
slightly modified version of the Logistic regression model from the previous
module.

## Model Representation & Forward Computation

For the programming assignment this week we'll be implementing the model
represenation and forward computation of a fully connected neural network with
Sigmoid activations. The model represenation will be done using Object Oriented
programming and Sigmoid activations at each layer will consist of a slightly
modified version of the Logistic regression model from the previous module.

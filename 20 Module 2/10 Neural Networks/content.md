# Neural Networks

These videos by Andrew outline what a neural network looks like, and give some
good intuitions on why it is such a useful model. They should be a good first
introduction into what neural networks are exactly. These videos do not yet
cover how exactly to train a neural network.

## Backpropagation: Training a neural network

The algorithm to learn the weights of a neural network based on training data
is called *backpropagation* and is quite a difficult algorithm to completely
understand. Introducing backpropagation in its general form will be one of the
main topics of the *next* neural networks module.

Here, for a high level overview of what backpropagation tries to do and
how neural networks end up being used in practice, we'll refer to these
introductory videos by *3blue1brown*.

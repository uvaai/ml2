# Neural Networks

*All the videos below are entirely optional, and will not be a part of the exam
material.*

For the past 7 weeks we've been studying the fundamentals of machine learning,
including the required mathematical tools, core theoretical concepts and the
details of specific algorithms. With all these fundamentals under our belt,
we've actually also developed the language required to discuss one of the
largest, most complex and most active area's in all of machine learning: Neural
networks.

While this is much too large a topic to fit at the end of this course, it also
would be a shame to not show how far you've come, and that understanding the
components of this very abstract algorithm is now actually within reach. The
videos below from Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course on Coursera give a very
good introduction into what the components of a neural network are exactly, and
why it is such a powerful model.

## Backpropagation: Training a neural network

These videos by Andrew outline what a neural network looks like, and give some
good intuitions on why it is such useful model, but they do not yet cover how
to actually train a neural network model. The algorithm to learn the weights of
a neural network based on training data is called *backpropagation* and is a
quite a difficult algorithm to completely understand. Introducing backpropagion
in its most general form will be one of the main topics of *Introduction to
Machine Learning 2*.

Here, for a very high level overview of what backpropagation tries to do and
how neural networks end up being used in practice, we'll refer to these
introductory videos by *3blue1brown*.
